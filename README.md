# Bank Account Management System (Java)

This is a simple Java console application for managing a bank account. It is built using Core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like encapsulation and method overloading.

The program allows users to do basic banking operations such as:
- Depositing money
- Withdrawing money
- Checking the account balance
- Viewing account details

The main class in this program is `BankAccount`. It holds important account information such as the account number, account holder name, and the current balance. All data is private and accessed using methods, which shows the use of encapsulation.

The `BankProject` class runs the program and provides a menu in the console. Users can enter their choice to perform actions. The application also checks for common errors, like trying to deposit a negative amount or withdraw more than the available balance.
